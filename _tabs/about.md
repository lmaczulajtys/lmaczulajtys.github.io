Hi, My name is ≈Åukasz. I have been programming for more than 20 years. Mainly in Java and for banking sector. I am an architect helping teams to build software in AWS, Google Cloud and Azure. I'm also a big fan of agile methodologies. From time to time, I change the role of a technical leader into a Scrum Master or Product Owner.

Privately, I'm a rock climber, cyclist and dad.

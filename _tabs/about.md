Hi, My name is ≈Åukasz. I have been programming for more than 20 years, mainly in Java, JavaScript and Python. I have been working for banking, telecom, media and FMCG sectors. I am an architect helping teams to build software in public cloud (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure). I also help improving and optimizing software development process.

I'm a big fan of agile methodologies. From time to time, I change the role of a technical leader into a Scrum Master or Product Owner.

Privately, I'm a rock climber, cyclist and dad.
